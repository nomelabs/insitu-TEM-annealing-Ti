# In situ TEM annealing of neutron-irradiated Ti reveals a mechanism for elevated temperature radiation damage recovery
## Contents
Below, an explanation of the contents of each section in this repository can be found.
### Heating Curve
This folder contains a graph showing the heating profile of the sample, as well as a text file with all of the data pertaining to the chip's heating over the course of the in-situ experiment. The sample is a 0.8~dpa neutron-irradiated commercially-pure Grade 2 (CP-2) Ti sample subject to a heating rate of 20\degree C/min between 25--600\degree C. For this study, only the dynamic heating section was analyzed.
### Line and Loop Movement Frames
Here, each frame showing the movement of a line and loop dislocation can be found, these are the frames which were used to create the videos pertaining to this movement.
### Orientation and Thickness
In the Diffraction Pattern image, the diffraction pattern of the region of interest can be found, which was used to find the orientation shown in the Orientation image.

An EFTEM map of the region of interest can be found in the Region Thickness image. The thickness of the region shown in the video is about 170 nm, which was calculated using the mfp value found from the map (1.6 mfp) with the known mfp value of titanium at 200 keV (106 nm).
### Original Frames
This folder contains each of the frames which were manually annotated prior to the annotations being made.
### Polygon Annotation Analysis
In this folder, the subfolder annotated images shows the frames post-annotation. The annotation data subfolder contains the polygonal annotations for each frame, and the raw images folder contains the images prior to annotating. The script in this folder is the script used to plot the annotations created using an external software, Roboflow, back onto the original frames.
### Videos
This folder contains the video of the chip during its in-situ heating from 100C and up. The line and loop movement videos are also present here.
