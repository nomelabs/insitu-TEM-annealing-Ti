# _In situ_ TEM annealing of neutron-irradiated Ti reveals a two-stage mechanism for elevated temperature radiation damage recovery
## Contents
Below, an explanation of the contents of each section in this repository can be found.

### Heating Curve
This folder contains a graph showing the heating profile of the sample, as well as a text file with all of the data pertaining to the chip's heating over the course of the _in situ_ experiment. The sample is a 0.8 dpa neutron-irradiated commercially-pure Grade 2 (CP-2) Ti sample subject to a heating rate of 20°C/min between 25-600°C. For this study, only the dynamic heating section was analyzed.

### Line and Loop Movement Frames
Here, each frame showing the movement of a line and loop dislocation can be found, these are the frames which were used to create the videos pertaining to this movement.

### Orientation and Thickness
For the diffraction pattern image: (a) Low magnification TEM image showing the region which was analyzed during _in situ_ heating, including the region where the diffraction pattern (DP 1702) was taken. (b) Diffraction pattern taken from region indicated in (a) showing the two beam condition used during imaging with **g** = 1 0 3 near a zone axis of [-3 1 1].

For the orientation image: (a) Stereographic projection showing the orientation of the **c** axis with respect to the images taken. (b) Image with overlayed orientations denoting the **c** direction and the resulting **a** direction of movement.

The thickness map image shows an energy-filtered Transmission Electron Microscopy (EFTEM) map for the imaged region. The lamella thickness ~170nm was calculated using the mean free path (mfp) value, for Ti at 200keV this equals 106nm, multiplied by the thickness factor obtained from the analyzed region, 1.6 mfp.

### Original Frames
This folder contains each of the frames which were manually annotated prior to the annotations being made.

### Polygon Annotation Analysis
In this folder, the subfolder annotated images shows the frames post-annotation. The annotation data subfolder contains the polygonal annotations for each frame, and the raw images folder contains the images prior to annotating. The script in this folder is the script used to plot the annotations created using an external software, Roboflow, back onto the original frames.

### Videos
This folder contains the video of the chip during its _in situ_ heating from 100°C and up. The line and loop movement videos are also present here.
